Color Pack
==========

This started as a fork of [Color-Sampler-Pack](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Color-Sampler-Pack) but then I added more themes like the Tomorrow line (Tomorrow, Tomorrow Night, etc), ir_black, etc.

Installation
---

If you're running Vundle then all you need is to add the following line to your `~/.vimrc`:

```vimL
Bundle 'daviddavis/vim-colorpack'
```

Otherwise, if you're running pathogen, run this commands from the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daviddavis/vim-colorpack.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-colorpack
```

If you're not running Vundle or pathogen, then you need to be.


A Note About Solarized
---

I've included two [ Solarized ]( https://github.com/altercation/solarized ), a light and a dark one, so that you get the functionality you would by setting background to light/dark. The theme included
here only has some basic functionality so if you really like the theme, I recommend installing the solarized vim plugin and reading up on the documentation.

Thank you and enjoy!
