Color Pack
==========

This started as a fork of (Color-Sampler-Pack)[https://github.com/vim-scripts/Color-Sampler-Pack] but then I added more themes like the Tomorrow line (Tomorrow, Tomorrow Night, etc), ir_black, etc.


A Note About Solarized
---

I've included two (Solarized)[https://github.com/altercation/solarized], a light and a dark one, so that you get the functionality you would by setting background to light/dark. The theme included
here only has some basic functionality so if you really like the theme, I recommend installing the solarized vim plugin and reading up on the documentation.

Thank you and enjoy!
